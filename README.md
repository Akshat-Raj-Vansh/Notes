## Data Management
ArrayList Datastructure has been used in this app which is used to store the content of the notes. The ArrayList is then put into an arrayAdapter which is then set to the listView for displaying the content.

For permanent storage we have used "SharedPreferences" which helps to keep the data stored even if the app is shut down.
